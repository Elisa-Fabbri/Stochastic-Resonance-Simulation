# Stochastic-Resonance-Simulation

## General Introduction and Objective of the Repository

Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon observed in nonlinear systems, wherein a weak input signal, like a faint signal, can be enhanced and optimized through the 
presence of noise.
The three basic characteristics are (i) the presence of an energetic activation barrier (or a form of threshold), (ii) a weak coherent input (such as a periodic
signal), and (iii) a source of noise. Given these features, the responce of the system undergoes a resonance-like behaviour as a function of the noise level.

The concept of stochastic resonance was initially introduced by Italian physicists Roberto Benzi, Alfonso Sutera, and Angelo Vulpiani in 1981. In their pioneering 
work, they explored its potential applications in the field of climate dynamics, alongside Giorgio Parisi.

The aim of this repository is to investigate the stochastic resonance phenomenon through numerical simulations in the particular case of a climate model.
